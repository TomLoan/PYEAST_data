Sequences extracted from PYTK MoClo kit from Lee et al 2015. 

This MoClo kit is encoded with specfic standards: 

Part type:
    1. Assembly connector, non-coding, non-regulatory. Contains BsmBI sites for level 2 assemblies
    2. Promoters, end in a start codon 
    3. Coding sequence, lacks a 5' start and 3' stop codon - contained in the BsaI overhang
    3a. N-terminal coding sequence 
    3b. coding sequence - typically requires a 5' type 3a 
    4. Terminator, begins with a stop codon 
    4a. C-terminal coding seqeunce. Contains a 3' stop codon
    4b Terminator, no stop codon, designed for use with 4a parts. 
    5. Assembly conecter, non-coding, non regulatory. Contains BsmBI stires for level 2 assemblies
    6. Yeast marker, either auxotrophic or antibiotic selection
    7. Yeast replication origin, 2u or CEN/ARS or 3' homology for integration
    8. Bacterial origin and resistance marker (e.g. AmpR-ColE1)
    8a. Bacterial origin and resistance marker (e.g. AmpR-ColE1) for integrative plasmids
    8b. 5' homology for integration

You should create level 1 assemblies inthe logical order 1,2,3, 4a,4b etc. 

There are some special combo parts included to save you time in assembling:
